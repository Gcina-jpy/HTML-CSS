# HTML-CSS

html 

-HTML forms the foundation of website and web app development. 
-allows you to make sure your content is understandable to both people and computers.
-HTML is a language used to structure web pages.
-It uses tags, which are enclosed in less-than and greater-than symbols, to mark different elements.

FOR EXAMPLE: <P>This is a paragrap</p> 

<p> - being the opening tag
"This is a paragraph " - being content 
</p> - being the closing tag 

- These tags work together to define elements.which are like packages containing content.
- the purpose of an html markup is to give meaning to the content and help computers understand

- theres also nested hlml emlements 

FOR EXAMPLE :  <p>this is a paragraph that has <em>emphasized text</em> for effect </p>
- <em></em> being the nested tag 



-an entire HTML document is basically a bunch of HTML elements nested inside each other

FOR EXAMPLE : <article> 
              <h1>head</h1>
              <p>paragraph ONE</p>
              <p>paragraph TWO</p>
              <p>paragraph THREE has <em>emphasized text</em></P>
              </article>
this structure tells that article has one headline 3 paragraphs with third having emphasized text  

NOTE H1 AND P TAGS ARE NESTED IN ARTICLE ELEMENT !
